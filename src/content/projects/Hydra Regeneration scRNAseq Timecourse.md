# Interstitial cells transcription factors in *Hydra Vulgaris* regeneration over 96 hours

Rotation in Celina Juliano's lab studying the timeline of hydra regeneration after bisection using scRNAseq obtained from Panagiotis Papasaikas from the Tsiairis lab.

## Introduction

Data from our collaborator Panagiotis rds file for a SingleCellExperiment object containing the single cell data for **the interstitial cells** of *Hydra Vulgaris* during multiples stages of regeneration after bisection:

<https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.02.08.579449>

BUT they mapped it to *Hydra Magnipapillata* (102 version of 105) "Quantification of the generated single cell libraries was performed using the Salmon-Alevin software suite 
(Salmon version 1.6.0) against the ncbi Hydra 102 transcriptome."

The sce object contains only the interstitial cells that were selected by Panagiotis using the ..... markers -> Not indicated in the preprint either.

The coldata of the object contain cell annotation including

-   quality metrics: nFeature nCount (not MT percentage interestingly)
-   batch info: either 2869 (3162 barcodes), 3113 (10352 barcodes), 3271
    (13279 barcodes), 3357 (3875 barcodes)
-   originating experiments (head or foot regeneration)
-   experimental time points
-   pseudo-axis assignment (vals.axis ranging from -1 to 1, increasing in
    the foot-tentacle direction)
-   mitotic and apoptotic signatures indices from 0 to 1

The rowdata contains gene annotation, using Entrez-gene identifiers. I
have also noticed that in the sce objects there's

-   PCA, tSNE and UMAP coordinates for reduced dimensions + corrected
    for batch values
-   assay metafeatures hold gene_id, product, gene, is.rib.prot.gene
    (T/F), HypoMarkers (T/F), ccyle (T/F), apopt (T/F) etc

I converted the sce objects into a seurat object and did data processing + analysis.

## Reports summary

-    interstitial_report3
-    interstitial_report4_cluster_attribution
-    interstitial_report5_transcription_timeline
-    Interstitial_report6_population_evolution
-    Interstitial_report7_population_evolution
-    PowerPoint presentation I gave to the lab in the last week of my rotation
-    seurat_all_modifications_reports_1to7.R

## Interstitial_report1

-    Contains the exploration of the data (batches, features, metadata etc)
-    Quality check based on nFeatures and nCounts (no mitochondrial genes in the 102 genome)
-    Scaling using SCTransform() and regression (or not) of the batch variable
-    Selection of the first 28 dimensions for UMAP projection
-    PCA, UMAP, Clustering at different resolutions (0.025, 0.1, 0.3)

## Interstitial_report2_cluster_attribution

Subsetting by head/foot and timepoint for both regressed and unregressed
Not batch regressed
Batch regressed
Cluster attribution
UMAP at 0.025 resolution
Finding markers per clusters
-    DotPlot of top 5 differentially expressed markers per clusters
-    DotPlot of theoretical markers for neurons and other interstitial cells
-    UMAPs of names markers (excludes uncharacterized transcripts)

## Interstitial_report3

Contains the same thing as the first report but explores the n_neighbors parameter

Does not contain the regressed data as the batch and timepoints variables overlapped weirdly in the experimental design

## Interstitial_report4_cluster_attribution

Contains the same things as report2 BUT
-    more markers
-    plots using the regressed data were discarded
-    clusters were attributed
-    we now have a first glimpse at transcription factor expression

## Interstitial_report5_transcription_timeline

Subclustered to only neurons in order to study neuron subtypes and appearances throughout regenaration.
Allows for FindMarkers between clusters and timepoints.

Filtered to neurons only and re-clustered:

-    PCA, UMAP at 0.025 resolution
-    New cluster attribution (9 neuronal cell types)
-    Subgrouped per timepoints and per regenerating organ (head vs foot)
-    Plotting of cell population number over time (head vs foot)
-    Transcription factor of interest expression: Feature plot and clustered dotplot

## Interstitial_report6_population_evolution

Contains:

-    Notes on a meeting with Celina and Hannah and what to change in report 5
-    UMAP and cluster labelling at resolution = 0.1 instead of 0.025
-    Subsetting by cluster and over time
-    Evolution of cell population over time: Raw counts and percentage composition of the Hydra + divided by head of foot
-    Transcription factor expression: Feature plot all timepoints + Dotplot over time
-    Transcription factor expression: Over time

This report describes a changing cell population and ties it back to specific transcription factor expression.

## Interstitial_report7_population_evolution

-    Notes on a meeting with Celina and Hannah and what to change in report 6
-    Relabelling the clusters (although I believe the en cluster should be changed back to doublet/triplet because of the apoptosis score)
-    Plotting cell cycle scores, axis scores and apoptosis scores

This is the report that was used to make the powerpoint I added here.

## seurat_all_modifications_reports_1to7.R

Summary of all operations done to the initial Seurat assay. This should make it easier for anyone to pick up the project/data analysis in the future.

## Nota Bene

The 102 genome is very fractionated and is poorly annotated compared to current available constructs.
I had to manually cross 105 v3 genome for the previously established celltype markers with the 105 v102 genome.
I did that by taking the 105 v3 fasta file Hannah gave me, blasting every established cell type marker transcript and finding if there's a >80% match for a transcript in 102. 
Then I went back to the annotation file and changed the name of the transcript in a duplicated Symbol column called Symbol_updated.
I also manually checked annotated genes that had a transcript in 102 but the ID didn't reflect it.
This is stored in an excel document called "mcbi_dataset_MH_annotated.xlsx"
